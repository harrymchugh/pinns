## Project Motivation
Many computational simulations are too intensive to be useful, even with the use of modern supercomputing facilities. 

This is particularly true of fluid dynamics codes, and even more so, when the Reynolds number is very high.

Machine learning has scope to improve the performance of these simulations, by shifting much of the computation "offline" into the model training phase, leaving almost real-time simulation via inference.

## Project hypothesis
Physics informed neural networks have been seen to perform better than traditional deep learning models when learning physical laws.
